# COVID-19 Global Data Atlas

## General Information

The COVID-19 Global Data Atlas is your go-to resource for a comprehensive view of the COVID-19 landscape worldwide. We bring together data from various health authorities, both at the national and international levels to help you make informed decisions, assess trends, and gain valuable insights into the ongoing global impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.

While general COVID-19 data is available at the global level, additional unique data is often published by various national and local governments, reflecting their local nuances. Our atlas embraces this diversity, offering a more detailed and comprehensive perspective compared to global summaries. We curate a growing collection of specific data sources, ensuring you get a richer understanding of the global picture.

Our goal with this product is to make the data more accessible without sacrificing its authenticity. This involves converting non-tabular data into tables, cleaning up column names, and translating non-English terms. The result is a clear and unembellished representation of original published data.

The dataset is updated daily, although the underlying data sources mostly provide weekly summaries. We aim to provide you with the most up-to-date information while respecting the reporting cadence of the original sources.
