# EpiLake Flu: Advanced Influenza Global Surveillance

## General Information

EpiLake Flu stands as a cutting-edge solution for understanding the global landscape of influenza. Drawing from a diverse array of authorities, both national and international, this platform elevates the raw data to a refined and enriched level, tailored for strategic business applications.

While traditional sources like the WHO or the CDC provide consolidated influenza data, individual countries and states often present region-specific nuances in their own formats through distinct health agencies. EpiLake Flu not only amalgamates these diverse global sources but goes a step further, transforming, enriching, and predicting to offer a sophisticated and business-ready dataset.

Unlike our Influenza Global Data Atlas, which meticulously preserves data in its original format, EpiLake Flu is a sophisticated transformation. Non-tabular sources are converted into structured tables, data undergoes translation into English, metrics are intelligently aggregated across dimensions and sources, and supplementary data sources are integrated to enhance the influenza dataset. Additionally, a suite of predictive features, fueled by robust forecasts and Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) data, enhances the offering.

## Key Attributes

EpiLake Flu includes a host of key attributes:

- **In-depth Influenza Metrics**: Precise global figures for positive flu tests, total tests conducted, diagnosed flu cases, hospitalizaitons, and more provide a comprehensive view of the influenza landscape.
- **Influenza Metric Predictions**: Utilizing state-of-the-art forecasts and Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) data, EpiLake Flu goes beyond the present by offering aggregated predictions for key time-series influenza metrics.
- **Integrated Analytics Capabilities**: EpiLake Flu seamlessly integrates with analytics platforms, empowering businesses to tailor the data for impactful visualizations and sophisticated time-series analysis. This integration ensures flexibility in modifying the data product to meet specific analytical needs.
