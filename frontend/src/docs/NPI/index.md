# CMS - National Provider Identifier (NPI) registry


The National Provider Identifier (NPI) registry is maintained by the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES).

Since 2008, all healthcare providers have been required to register with NPI. This dataset contains all FOIA-releasable information from those registrations.

Key Attributes:

- **Provider Details**: Comprehensive profiles, legal identities, contact information, email addresses, website URLs, alternate physical addresses, and alternate names.
- **Taxonomy and Licensing**: Primary taxonomy codes (medical specialization), licensing numbers, and associated states.
- **Authorized Officials**: Key officials within healthcare organizations, including their titles and contact information.
- **Parent-Child Relationships**: Connections between healthcare providers and parent organizations, including legal business names and TINs.

Included Datasets:

- **NPI_DATA_MONTHLY**: This is the bulk of the NPI registry, containing a wide variety of data about each NPI-registered healthcare provider.
- **NPI_PRIMARY_LOCATION_MONTHLY**: Stores information about a practice's additional location, if applicable.
- **NPI_ENDPOINT_MONTHLY**: Provides various ways a practice can be found, such as email addresses or URLs.
- **NPI_OTHERNAME_MONTHLY**: Provides alternative names a practice goes by.

Additional Info:

- A common `npi` ID field connects all the tables.
- Explanations of codes are available from CMS: https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/administrative-simplification/nationalprovidentstand/downloads/data_dissemination_file-code_values.pdf

# What is the NPI Registry?

The NPI registry contains FOIA-releasable information about all healthcare providers in the US. This generally includes
names of doctors and medical centers, public contact information, addresses, and medical specializations. Each provider
is uniquely identified by their NPI number.

> The National Provider Identifier (NPI) is a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Administrative
> Simplification Standard. The NPI is a unique identification number for covered health care providers. Covered health
> care providers and all health plans and health care clearinghouses must use the NPIs in the administrative and financial
> transactions adopted under HIPAA. The NPI is a 10-position, intelligence-free numeric identifier (10-digit number). This
> means that the numbers do not carry other information about healthcare providers, such as the state in which they live
> or their medical specialty. The NPI must be used in lieu of legacy provider identifiers in the HIPAA standards
> transactions.

> As outlined in the Federal Regulation, The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA),
> covered providers must also share their NPI with other providers, health plans, clearinghouses, and any entity that may
> need it for billing purposes.
