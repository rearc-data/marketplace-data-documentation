# What is the CTTI AACT Database?

The CTTI AACT Database, or Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative Aggregate Analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov (CTTI AACT), is a comprehensive and publicly available relational database. It contains a wide array of 
information, including protocol and result data elements, about every clinical study registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. This database serves as a valuable resource for aggregating and analyzing data related to clinical 
trials, making it a key asset for researchers, analysts, and organizations in the healthcare and clinical research domains.
